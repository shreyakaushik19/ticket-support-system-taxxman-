Introduction:
Welcome to our AI-powered Support Ticketing System! We've created a seamless solution to streamline your support experience.
Our system intelligently categorizes and prioritizes your tickets, ensuring that urgent matters receive prompt attention. Using cutting-edge AI algorithms, we analyze ticket content to provide automated responses and suggest solutions based on past resolutions. This means quicker resolutions and happier customers. 
With a user-friendly interface and advanced automation, we're revolutionizing support ticket management.

Coding Implementation:

1. Ticket Submission Interface: Developed a web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for users to submit tickets. Integrated form validation for detailed descriptions, categorization dropdowns, and urgency level selection.
2. AI Categorization and Prioritization: Employed natural language processing (NLP) techniques with libraries like NLTK in Python to analyze ticket content. Utilized keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and urgency classification algorithms to categorize and prioritize tickets.
